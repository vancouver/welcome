# Welcome

Welcome to the Vancouver Meetups community.

## Purpose

The purpose of Vancouver Meetups is to provide an inclusive and friendly place
for open participation in the organization of tech events/meetups in Vancouver.

We strive to build a community without distinction of "organizers" versus
"participants" of events. Anyone can be a contributor, anyone can be an
enabling force in making events happen. We hope to create an environment that
promotes safe, positive and rewarding experiences for all participants.

## Get involved!

If you want to get involved, the simplest way is to join the discussions in the
Github issues. You can make suggestions, provide feedback on proposals, or
simply help direct particular issues at other community members who you feel
could provide some valid input or help.

If you wish to get involved in a larger capacity, you can always help finding
venues, sponsors and presenters. More options are better.
