# Code of Conduct

## This is an inclusive and safe community

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status,
ability, and religion (or lack thereof). If you feel uncomfortable for any
reason, or see someone else in an uncomfortable situation, let a community
leader know as soon as possible! We want to help!

## Make positive relationships

We hope that you can build many great friendships through involvement in this
community and that you feel compelled to help others to make friends, and to
inspire them to do the same. If you see someone making an extra effort to make
this community great, let us know!

## Unacceptable behaviour

Do not engage in any speech or actions that could be deemed as discriminatory,
derogatory, harassing, abusive, intimidating or demeaning online, at events
or in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of the community.

This includes, but may not be limited to: harmful or prejudicial comments about
gender, race, sexual orientation, religion or disability; inappropriate use
of nudity and/or sexual imagery (including presentation slides); deliberate
intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording;
sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Consequences of unacceptable behaviour

Be accountable for your actions. Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated.
If asked to cease any behaviour deemed unacceptable, you will be expected to
comply immediately or face temporary or permanent expulsion from the community.
Depending on severity of transgressions, community leaders may engage with law
enforcement and/or personally help those feeling victimized to feel safe again,
to whatever capacity that requires.

## ‏Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or
otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this
Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-
person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining
to community business.
